It was all a dream, thought Johnny as he awoke in a cold sweat from his 
dream. Ever since that weekend watching non-stop alien shows, Johnny had 
been having nightmares. He looked around to try to comfort himself.  
Nothing in his bedroom changed.  It was exactly the same as it was last 
night, his bed facing the window with his desk to his left and the door 
on his right.  "I'm getting way too old to be spooked by aliens," Johnny 
told himself. As he was getting himself out of bed, he felt a chill.  
Following the breeze, Johnny saw a crack, the bottom of the window was 
slightly open. He dropped his phone in terror, he had never opened the 
window before.

Johnny walked closer to the window, holding his breath. He wanted to
shut the window, tightly, so that those freaking aliens will not be
able to break through the windows easily. He shut the windows, and pushed
them to make sure they were indeed closed. Yes, they were close; no breeze
could sneak into the room. It was such a great relief to him. He 
turned around, letting go of 
the breath that had been holding for a while. He laughed, realizing
how naive and frightening he was. "Ha, that didn't scare me at all. I'm a man
, a manly man," he thought. Yet, when he turned around to grab a glipse of
the full moon before going to bed, he found some liquid oozing into the
room from the edges of the windows. He then recognized the smell
of blood.

Frightened, Johnny jumped out of bed once again. He turned the lights on. The 
window was wide open, swinnging back and forth. Walking up to the window, the 
smell got more noticable. As he peered down he saw the aliens levatating, and
inspecting his dog. Johnny, without thinking yelled "Fluffy!". The dog 
instantly dropped to the ground. Simultaneously, a spotlight was shined at
the window Johnny was looking out of.

As Johnny saw the spotlight, he smiled and then bowed to the audience in the 
theatre. It was all about a drama! Expressing his feeling and emotions so well,
Johnny won the golden prize of the 3rd UW Drama Festival. However, as he finished 
his speech in the hall, a truely aliens with frightened face smiled and told his 
allies to start the mission. Johnny did not feel that at all. After he went home, 
similar scenrios as the plot in the drama appeared in his mind. Johnny woke up 
with wet palm in his really life at this time. He held his breathe and wanted to shut
the windows...
