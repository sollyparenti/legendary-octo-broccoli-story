It was all a dream, thought Johnny as he awoke in a cold sweat from his 
dream. Ever since that weekend watching non-stop alien shows, Johnny had 
been having nightmares. He looked around to try to comfort himself.  
Nothing in his bedroom changed.  It was exactly the same as it was last 
night, his bed facing the window with his desk to his left and the door 
on his right.  "I'm getting way too old to be spooked by aliens," Johnny 
told himself. As he was getting himself out of bed, he felt a chill.  
Following the breeze, Johnny saw a crack, the bottom of the window was 
slightly open. He dropped his phone in terror, he had never opened the 
window before.
